/**
 * Configuration of PooledGMService that provides a number of configuration parameters.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setMaxActive <i>maxActive</i>} controls the maximum number of GM connections that can be allocated by the
 * pool (checked out to clients, or idle awaiting checkout) at a given time. When non-positive, there is no limit to the
 * number of GM connections that can be managed by the pool at one time. When {@link #setMaxActive <i>maxActive</i>} is
 * reached, the pool is said to be exhausted. The default setting for this parameter is 8.</li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setMaxIdle <i>maxIdle</i>} controls the maximum number of GM connections that can sit idle in the pool at any
 * time. When negative, there is no limit to the number of GM connections that may be idle at one time. The default
 * setting for this parameter is 8.</li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setWhenExhaustedAction <i>whenExhaustedAction</i>} specifies the behavior of the
 * {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} method when the pool is exhausted:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * When {@link #setWhenExhaustedAction <i>whenExhaustedAction</i>} is {@link WhenExhaustedAction#FAIL},
 * {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} will throw a {@link NoSuchElementException}</li>
 * <li>
 * When {@link #setWhenExhaustedAction <i>whenExhaustedAction</i>} is {@link WhenExhaustedAction#GROW},
 * {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} will create a new GM connection and return it (essentially making
 * {@link #setMaxActive <i>maxActive</i>} meaningless.)</li>
 * <li>
 * When {@link #setWhenExhaustedAction <i>whenExhaustedAction</i>} is {@link WhenExhaustedAction#BLOCK},
 * {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} will block (invoke {@link Object#wait()}) until a new or idle GM connection
 * is available. If a positive {@link #setMaxWait <i>maxWait</i>} value is supplied, then
 * {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} will block for at most that many milliseconds, after which a
 * {@link NoSuchElementException} will be thrown. If {@link #setMaxWait <i>maxWait</i>} is non-positive, the
 * {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} method will block indefinitely.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The default <code>whenExhaustedAction</code> setting is {@link WhenExhaustedAction#BLOCK} and the default
 * <code>maxWait</code> setting is -1. By default, therefore, {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} will block
 * indefinitely until an idle instance becomes available.</li>
 * <li>
 * When {@link #setTestOnGet <i>testOnGet</i>} is set, the pool will attempt to validate each GM connection before it is
 * returned from the {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} method. (Using the provided factory's
 * {@link PoolableObjectFactory#validateObject} method.) Objects that fail to validate will be dropped from the pool,
 * and a different GM connection will be returned. The default setting for this parameter is <code>false.</code></li>
 * <li>
 * When {@link #setTestOnReturn <i>testOnReturn</i>} is set, the pool will attempt to validate each GM connection before
 * it is returned to the pool in the {@link #returnObject} method. (Using the provided factory's
 * {@link PoolableObjectFactory#validateObject} method.) Objects that fail to validate will be dropped from the pool.
 * The default setting for this parameter is <code>false.</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Optionally, one may configure the pool to examine and possibly evict GM connections as they sit idle in the pool and
 * to ensure that a minimum number of idle GM connections are available. This is performed by an
 * "idle GM connection eviction" thread, which runs asynchronously. Caution should be used when configuring this
 * optional feature. Eviction runs contend with client threads for access to GM connections in the pool, so if they run
 * too frequently performance issues may result. The idle GM connection eviction thread may be configured using the
 * following attributes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setTimeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis <i>timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis</i>} indicates how long the eviction thread
 * should sleep before "runs" of examining idle GM connections. When non-positive, no eviction thread will be launched.
 * The default setting for this parameter is -1 (i.e., idle GM connection eviction is disabled by default).</li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis <i>minEvictableIdleTimeMillis</i>} specifies the minimum amount of time that an
 * GM connection may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction due to idle time. When non-positive, no GM
 * connection will be dropped from the pool due to idle time alone. This setting has no effect unless
 * <code>timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis > 0.</code> The default setting for this parameter is 30 minutes.</li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setTestWhileIdle <i>testWhileIdle</i>} indicates whether or not idle GM connections should be validated using
 * the factory's {@link PoolableObjectFactory#validateObject} method. Objects that fail to validate will be dropped from
 * the pool. This setting has no effect unless <code>timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis > 0.</code> The default setting for
 * this parameter is <code>false.</code></li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setSoftMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis <i>softMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis</i>} specifies the minimum amount of time
 * a GM connection may sit idle in the pool before it is eligible for eviction by the idle GM connection evictor (if
 * any), with the extra condition that at least "minIdle" GM connection instances remain in the pool. When non-positive,
 * no GM connection will be evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. This setting has no effect unless
 * <code>timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis > 0.</code> and it is superceded by {@link #setMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis
 * <i>minEvictableIdleTimeMillis</i>} (that is, if <code>minEvictableIdleTimeMillis</code> is positive, then
 * <code>softMinEvictableIdleTimeMillis</code> is ignored). The default setting for this parameter is -1 (disabled).</li>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setNumTestsPerEvictionRun <i>numTestsPerEvictionRun</i>} determines the number of GM connections examined in
 * each run of the idle GM connection evictor. This setting has no effect unless
 * <code>timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis > 0.</code> The default setting for this parameter is 3.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The pool can be configured to behave as a LIFO queue with respect to idle GM connections - always returning the most
 * recently used GM connection from the pool, or as a FIFO queue, where {@link PooledGMService#getConnection()} always
 * returns the oldest GM connection in the idle GM connection pool.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@link #setLifo <i>lifo</i>} determines whether or not the pool returns idle GM connections in last-in-first-out
 * order. The default setting for this parameter is <code>true.</code></li>
 * </ul>
